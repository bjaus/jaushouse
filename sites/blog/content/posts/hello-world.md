First post. This blog is where I'll write about Go, software architecture, and the things I'm building.

## What to expect

Mostly technical content:

- Deep dives into Go package design
- Architecture decisions and tradeoffs
- Building and self-hosting services on a Raspberry Pi
- Things I've learned the hard way

## The stack

This blog is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), deployed to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), and lives in a monorepo alongside the rest of [jaushouse.com](https://jaushouse.com).

```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println("let's go")
}
```

More soon.
